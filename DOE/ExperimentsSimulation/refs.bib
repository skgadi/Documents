	abstract = { This article reports the authors' efforts to develop a practice-based theory of content knowledge for teaching built on Shulman's (1986) notion of pedagogical content knowledge. As the concept of pedagogical content knowledge caught on, it was in need of theoretical development, analytic clarification, and empirical testing. The purpose of the study was to investigate the nature of professionally oriented subject matter knowledge in mathematics by studying actual mathematics teaching and identifying mathematical knowledge for teaching based on analyses of the mathematical problems that arise in teaching. In conjunction, measures of mathematical knowledge for teaching were developed. These lines of research indicate at least two empirically discernable subdomains within pedagogical content knowledge (knowledge of content and students and knowledge of content and teaching) and an important subdomain of “pure” content knowledge unique to the work of teaching, specialized content knowledge , which is distinct from the common content knowledge needed by teachers and nonteachers alike. The article concludes with a discussion of the next steps needed to develop a useful theory of content knowledge for teaching. }

Two designs with specific examples are discussed along with common misconceptions that undergraduate students typically bring to the experiment design process. Features of experiment design that maximize power and minimize the effects of interindividual variation, thus allowing reduction of sample sizes, are described. Classroom implementation that emphasizes student-centered learning is suggested, and thought questions, designed to help students discover and name the basic principles of simple experiment design for themselves, are included with an answer key.},

	abstract = "Many experiments could be improved with better experimental design and statistical analysis. Badly designed experiments can lead to incorrect conclusions and wasted time and scientific resources. Such experiments are unethical if they involve animals or humans. Good experimental design requires clearly defined objectives and control of the major sources of variation. In this article, a small mouse experiment involving the response of a liver enzyme to the administration of an antioxidant is used to illustrate some important design concepts such as the control and partitioning of sources of variation using factorial and randomized block designs and the estimation of appropriate sample sizes. Scientists clearly need better training in experimental design with better access to consultant statisticians for more complex situations. "

	abstract = { In this article, the authors first indicate the range of purposes and the variety of settings in which design experiments have been conducted and then delineate five crosscutting features that collectively differentiate design experiments from other methodologies. Design experiments have both a pragmatic bentâ€”â€œengineeringâ€ particular forms of learningâ€”and a theoretical orientationâ€”developing domain-specific theories by systematically studying those forms of learning and the means of supporting them. The authors clarify what is involved in preparing for and carrying out a design experiment, and in conducting a retrospective analysis of the extensive, longitudinal data sets generated during an experiment. Logistical issues, issues of measure, the importance of working through the data systematically, and the need to be explicit about the criteria for making inferences are discussed.}
