\begin{abstract}
One of the challenges in teaching the subject, Design of Experiments, is to come up with a proper numerical example. In this article, authors present a methodology to generate a numerical example for multifactorial experiments. Also, it presents a simple algorithm, which can be implemented in any programming language to generate unique examples.

\section{Introduction}
Experimental design is applied in almost all the fields involving experimentation \cite{fisher1937design,quinn2002experimental,montgomery2008design,antony2014design}. It is part of various undergraduate and graduate curriculum, ranging from the engineering to the biological sciences. In general the objective of experimental design is to minimize cost and time of the experiments and maximize the yield. Improper design of experiment may lead to inaccurate or false conclusions, as well as a loss of money, material and time \cite{Festing2003341}.
\par
Learning statistics or mathematics in general is effective by solving a number of numerical examples \cite{zhu1987learning}. It helps the students to develop insight in the topics \cite{renkl1997learning}. Teachers may involve students in finding experiments to teach the topic \cite{Hunter1977Some,fried2006mathematics,Hiebert82}. However, it is teacher's task to generate examples for the classroom and for the practise \cite{Deborah2008}.
\par
Solving optimization problems, finding mathematical model etc. in experimental design involves performing various experiments with a different combinations of the factors. Conducting experiments on a real system for the classroom purpose is not always feasible due to any the following limitations.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The cost of conducting experiments on a real system is not always negligible.
	\item A considerable amount of time may take for each experiment.
	\item The combination of factors associated for optimum response is constant for a physical system. Therefore, teachers may not provide a fresh problem.
\end{enumerate}
\par
Hence, a computer program generating responses for the given input factors is a good alternative to mimic the physical systems. In this article we present a methodology to generate numerical examples which simulate experiments. The objective is to generate unique process for the limits selected by the user, which ouputs experimental data for the given combinations of the factors. Teachers may adopt this methodology in generating numerical examples, which highlight all the characteristics they want to present to the classroom, give as practice exercise and conduct exams.
\par
The proposed algorithm is described in Section \ref{Sec:Algorithm}. Readers interested only in the implementation of algorithm may skip the mathematical construction presented in Section \ref{Sec:Construction} and \ref{Sec:Adapting}.
\par
A numerical example for an experimental design is a mathematical model representing a physical process. This model is a set of static functions (i.e. it does not have derivative or integral terms) which maps the factors to the responses. A real life system may present more than one peaks. However, most of the experimental design methods find the local maximum based on the initial base value. Hence, the proposed algorithm is designed to present only one peak. A multi-response system can be represented as %Because time is also a factor
\begin{eqnarray}
y_j &=& f_j(x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_n) + \xi_j \label{Eqn:Function}
\end{eqnarray}
\noindent where $y_j$, $j\in \{1,2,3, \dots, m\}$ are the responses, $x_i$, $i\in \{1,2,3, \dots, n\}$ are the factors, $f_j$, $j\in \{1,2,3, \dots, m\}$ are the nonlinear functions mapping the $n$ factors to the $m$ responses and $\xi_i$, $i\in \{1,2,3, \dots, m\}$ are the noise.
\par
All the factors, $x_i$, are constrained by upper and lower limits. The numerical examples should produce an unique optimal responses, $y_j^M$, for a set of factors within its limits. Construction of a one such mathematical function is presented in the next section.
\par
The proposed algorithm presents the case of single response, which can be adopted to multi-response.
\section{Construction of a mathematical function to suit our requirements}
\label{Sec:Construction}
In this section possible candidates for the function $f_i$  are discussed. The selected candidate function is then adapted to meet our further requirements in the next section.
\subsection{Quadratic concave function}
\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{images/poly-2-var}
	\label{Fig:TwoVariablePolynomial}
	\caption{Quadratic concave function $y=C_1(x_1, x_2)$.}
\end{figure}
A second order polynomial function, such as
\begin{eqnarray}
C_1(x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_n) &:=& -\sum_{i=1}^{n}{x_i^2} \label{Eqn:PolyFunction}
\end{eqnarray}
is a concave function, which serve the purpose of providing a unique optimal point. Figure~\ref{Fig:TwoVariablePolynomial} depicts (\ref{Eqn:PolyFunction}) for the two variables case. However, it doesn't meet the requirements of a good example because to the following limitations.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Response surface methodology uses a second order fit algorithm. Hence, the process of reaching optimal solution becomes trivial.
	\item A quadratic function is having a property that its slope increases as it moves far from the optimal point. This property trivializes the process of selecting a new base value.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Multivariable Gaussian function}
\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{images/2GussianFunction}
	\label{Fig:TwoVarGaussian}
	\caption{Two variable Gaussian function $y=C_2(x_1, x_2)$.}
\end{figure}
The multivariable Gussian function
\begin{eqnarray}
	C_2(x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_n) := \prod_{i=1}^{n}{\me^{-x_i^2}} \label{Eqn:MultiFactorialNormal}
\end{eqnarray}
is a concave function, hence, it has a unique maximum value. The slope of this function is not linearly related with the distance from its optimal point. The concave functions have property that the response of all the points between any two arbitrary points always grater than the responses at these arbitrary points \cite{antoniou2007practical}. A non-concave function gives additional challenge in solving the optimization problem. 
\subsection{Modified version of Gaussian function}
\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{images/2GussianFunctionModified}
	\label{Fig:2GussianFunctionModified}
	\caption{Modified version of Gaussian function $y=C_3(x_1, x_2)$.}
\end{figure}
Keeping above limitations in mind, a modified version of Gussian function is proposed as
\begin{eqnarray}
	C_3(x_1, x_2, x_3, ..., x_n) := \sum_{i=1}^{n}{\me^{-x_i^2}}. \label{Eqn:ModifiedGuassian}
\end{eqnarray}
\par
Figure~\ref{Fig:2GussianFunctionModified} depicts (\ref{Eqn:ModifiedGuassian}) for the case of two variables. A symmetric matrix is called negative definite when all its eigenvalues are negative. A function can be said concave, if Hessian matrix associated with it is negative definite \cite{bernstein1962some}. Hessian matrix for (\ref{Eqn:ModifiedGuassian}) is 
\begin{eqnarray}
	H_{i,j} = \pdv[2]{C_3}{x_i} =
	\begin{cases}
		2\me^{-x_i^2}(2x_i^2-1)	,	& \text{if } i = j\\
		0						,	& \text{otherwise}
	\end{cases} \label{Eqn:HessianMatrix}
\end{eqnarray}
where $i, j \in \{1, 2, 3, \dots, n\}$.
\par
The above equation shows that the Hessian matrix, $H$, is a diagonal matrix. In a diagonal matrix each element on the principal diagonal is an eigenvalue. So, we can comment that this matrix is not a negative definite because there exist positive elements for $|x_i|>\sqrt{\frac{1}{2}}$.
\par
In a function gradient is zero at the peaks, dips and saddle points. The gradient vector of (\ref{Eqn:ModifiedGuassian}) is
\begin{eqnarray}
	\Delta C_{3_i} = \pdv{C_3}{x_i} = -2x_i\me^{-x_i^2} \label{Eqn:GradientModifiedGuassian}
\end{eqnarray}
where $i \in \{1, 2, 3, \dots, n\}$. It can be observed that $\Delta C_{3_i} = 0$ implies $x_i =0$ or $x_i=\pm\infty$. Hence, it is guaranteed that there exists only one peak at $x_1 = x_2 = x_3 = \dots = x_n = 0$.
\par
In this function, the optimum value for a arbitrary factor $x_i$ is unaffected with the other factors. This is not recommended because it trivializes the multi-factorial problems.
\subsection{A novel mathematical function}
\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{images/2FactorsModifiedSine}
	\label{Fig:TwoVarNovelFunc}
	\caption{The proposed fucntion $y=C_4(x_1, x_2)$ for $a = 0.45$.}
\end{figure}
The following mathematical function is proposed by introducing a new nonlinear term to the above model.
\begin{eqnarray}
	C_4(.) := \sum_{i=1}^{n}{\exp[-\left(x_i + a\sin\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i\right)\right)^2]} \label{Eqn:Novelmodel}
\end{eqnarray}
\par
Figure~\ref{Fig:TwoVarNovelFunc} depicts $C_4$ for a two variable case with $a=0.45$. The gradient of $C_4$ is
\begin{eqnarray}
	\Delta C_{4_i} &=& \pdv{C_4}{x_i} \nonumber\\
	&=& -2\exp[-\left(x_i + a\sin\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i\right)\right)^2] \times \nonumber\\
	&& \left[ x_i + a\sin\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i\right) \right] \left[1 + a\cos\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i\right) \right] \label{Eqn:GradientNovelFunc}
\end{eqnarray}
where $i \in \{1, 2, 3, \dots, n\}$. Peaks, dips or saddle points form at 
\begin{eqnarray}
	\Delta C_{4_i}=0 \label{Eqn:GradientNovelEqn}
\end{eqnarray}
Only one peak is required, other peaks, dips and saddle points should be suppressed. Equation (\ref{Eqn:GradientNovelEqn}) can be solved by solving the following three equations.
\begin{eqnarray}
	\exp[-\left(x_i + a\sin\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i\right)\right)^2]=0 \label{Eqn:GradientNovelEqn1} \\
	x_i + a\sin\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i\right)=0 \label{Eqn:GradientNovelSol2} \\
	1 + a\cos\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i\right)=0 \label{Eqn:GradientNovelEqn3}
\end{eqnarray}
The solution for (\ref{Eqn:GradientNovelEqn1}) is $|x_i|=\infty$, which can be ignored. The solution for (\ref{Eqn:GradientNovelEqn3}) is
\begin{eqnarray}
	\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i &=& \cos[-1](\frac{-1}{a}) \label{Eqn:GradientNovelSol3}
\end{eqnarray}
Selecting a value $|a|<1$, we can suppress all the real solutions of (\ref{Eqn:GradientNovelSol3}). Equation (\ref{Eqn:GradientNovelSol2}) can be rewritten as 
\begin{eqnarray}
	x_i = -a\sin\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i\right) \label{Eqn:GradientNovelSol2ReWr1}
\end{eqnarray}
which implies that the solution lies at $x_1 = x_2 = x_3 = \dots = x_n$. Hence (\ref{Eqn:GradientNovelSol2ReWr1}) can be rewritten it as
\begin{eqnarray}
	nx_i + na\sin(nx_i) = 0 \label{Eqn:GradientNovelSol2ReWr2}
\end{eqnarray}
Since $|\sin(p)|<p$ for all the values of $p$ except for $p = 0$, the solution can be limited to only one point $x_1 = x_2 = x_3 = \dots = x_n=0$ provided that $|na|<1$. Considering a positive value for $a$, we guarantee only one peak at origin for $a<\frac{1}{n}$.
\par
In the next section a method is presented to adapt the function $C_4$ defined at (\ref{Eqn:Novelmodel}) to generate random experiments.
\section{Adapting the proposed function}
\label{Sec:Adapting}
Noise is added.
A scaled version of the function $C_4$ proposed in (\ref{Eqn:Novelmodel}) is
\begin{eqnarray}
	f(.) &:=& F_L + \frac{F_I}{2} \nonumber \\
	&+&\frac{F_I}{2}\sum_{i=1}^{n}{\exp[-\left(z_i + a\sin\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} z_i\right)\right)^2]}, \label{Eqn:AdaptedFunction} \\
	\Xi &:=& 0.5 (\xi + 1) \label{Eqn:ChangeOfRandomVar} \\
	F_I &:=& (F_U-F_L)\Xi \label{Eqn:FunctionInterval} \\
	z_i &:=& \frac{K_D(x_i-x_i^M)}{x_i^I}, \label{Eqn:ZiDefinition} \\
	x_i^I &:=& x_i^U - x_i^L, \label{Eqn:InterDefinition} \\
	x_i^M &:=& x_i^L + 0.5(1-\beta)x_i^I+\beta x_i^I\label{Eqn:FactorAtMaximumValue}
\end{eqnarray}
where  $i \in \{1, 2, 3, \dots, n\}$, $\xi$ is a random variable with the properties $E(\xi)=0$ and $|\xi|<1$, $\Xi$ is a random variable with the properties $E(\xi)=0.5$ and $|\xi|<1$,  $E(.)$ is the expected value. $[F_L, F_U]$ is the function range, $K_R$ is a noise factor, $K_D$ is difficulty factor, $x_i^M$ is the location of peak, $x_i^L$ and $x_i^U$ are lower and upper limit of the $i^{\text{th}}$ factor, 

The function $f(x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_n)$ preserves all the following mathematical properties of the function $C_4$ proposed in (\ref{Eqn:Novelmodel}).
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Has unique maximum value at $z_1 = z_2 = z_3 = \dots = z_n = 0$ i.e. at $x_i=x_i^M, \forall i\in\{1, 2, 3, \dots, n\}$, provided that $a<\frac{1}{n}$
\end{enumerate}
\par
It can be observed that the convex function, $C_4$, proposed in (\ref{Eqn:Novelmodel}) the previous section has a maximum value $C_4^{M}=2n$ at $x_i=0, \forall i\in\{1, 2, 3, \dots, n\}$, where $n$ is number of factors. 
\par

\par
$x_i^L$ and $x_i^U$ are the lower and upper limit for the $i^{\text{th}}$ factor. $x_i^M$ are the values for which $f$ obtains maximum value.
\begin{eqnarray}
	F(x_1, x_2, x_3, ..., x_n) = \sum_{i=1}^{i=n}{\frac{\me^{(x_i-x_i^M)}}{[\me^{(x_i-x_i^M)}+1]^2}}. \label{Eqn:DiffSigmoidMultiChangeMaxPoint}
\end{eqnarray}
A maximum value of $F_M$ is obtained by taking
\begin{eqnarray}
	F(x_1, x_2, x_3, ..., x_n) = \frac{4F_M}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{i=n}{\frac{\me^{(x_i-x_i^M)}}{[\me^{(x_i-x_i^M)}+1]^2}}. \label{Eqn:DiffSigmoidMultiChangeMaxValue}
\end{eqnarray}
\par
The maximum value, $F_M$, can be obtained by
\begin{eqnarray}
	F_M = F_L + \xi(F_U-F_L) \label{Eqn:MaxValueSelection}
\end{eqnarray}
where $F_L$ is lower limit, $F_M$ is upper limit $\xi$ is a constant random value, which helps to generate a new $F_M$ ever time the above function is invoked.
\par
The range of interest is between $x_i^L$ and $x_i^U$. A maximum value should be between these limits. Also, it is recommended not to move maximum values to the extremes. Hence we propose
\begin{eqnarray}
	x_i^M = x_i^L + \frac{\xi(1-\alpha)(x_i^U-x_i^L)}{2} \label{Eqn:MaxPointSelection}
\end{eqnarray}
where $0<\alpha <1$ is a constant and $0<\xi\le 1$ is a constant random number. $\alpha$ determines the region where maximum value may fall. The random value, $\xi$, allows to select a new point each time this function is invoked.

	\label{Fig:Flowchart}
	\caption{Flowchart}

Figure~\ref{Fig:Flowchart} shows the proposed algorithm.
\section{Application}
\label{Sec:Application}
\section{Conclusion}
\label{Sec:Conclusion}
The mathematical construction is given in detail, which helps others to adapt to meet any additional requirements.
\par
It is developed for maximum values, but can be adapted to the minimum by putting negative to the function and scaling accordingly.
