abstract={Very early experimental electric cars appeared just after electromagnetism was discovered, in 1820. During the nineteenth century they underwent improvements, staying in advance of internal combustion engines. A breakthrough came with the inventions of the rechargeable battery and of powerful and efficient electric motors, around 1870. Electrics peaked around the turn of the century, when they hold 38% of the automobile market in the US, compared with 40% of steam and 22% internal combustion. Their decline started in the second decade of the twentieth century when the internal combustion engine had a major boost, thanks to important advancements in the infrastructure, product and production technologies.},
